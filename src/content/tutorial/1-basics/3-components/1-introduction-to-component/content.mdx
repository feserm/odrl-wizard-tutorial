# Introduction to Components

The ODRL Builder is build from a collection of components. There exist two types of components: generic and entity-specific components. 
You can find them in the source code under `src/components/odrl/generic` and `src/components/odrl/entity`, respectively.

Preselected is the `String` component. It is a generic component that can be used to display a string value. You can see this component in action in the second step of the questionnaire. 
Where it is used to input the identifier of the ODRL policy.


## Generic Components

Let's take a closer look into the `String` component. First, you will see that it exports a bunch of variables. These variables are used to define the component from outside. 
For example, we can give the component a label. Other variables are used to store the value of the input field, if the input field is focused, or if the label should be displayed.

```js	
export let label = '';
export let odrlLevel = null;
export let attr;
export let value;
export let showLabel = true;
export let focus = false;
```

It is important to always bind the value of the input field to the `value` variable. This is, because this variable is taken by the parent component to sync it with the ODRL policy. 
The application takes care of the double binding, propagating changes to the input field as well as to the stored policy.

In the HTML section (below the `</script>`) of the component, add the following. This component contains a label and an input field.
```html add={1-18}
<section style="">
	<div class="">
		{#if showLabel}
			<!-- svelte-ignore a11y-label-has-associated-control -->
			<label class="label font-semibold text-sm underline">{label}</label>
		{/if}
		<input
			class="w-full input input-sm input-bordered"
			use:explanationAction
			use:setFocus
			data-odrlLevel={odrlLevel}
			data-attr={attr}
			type="text"
			bind:value
			on:change
		/>
	</div>
</section>
```

Let's take a look at each part by its own.

### Label

```html
{#if showLabel}
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-label-has-associated-control -->
    <label class="label font-semibold text-sm underline">{label}</label>
{/if}
```

You might notice the `#if` statement. This is special Svelte syntax to render the item only if the condition is true. 
In this case, the label is only rendered if the `showLabel` variable is set to `true`.

### Input Field

```html
<input
    class="w-full input input-sm input-bordered"
    use:explanationAction
    use:setFocus
    data-odrlLevel={odrlLevel}
    data-attr={attr}
    type="text"
    bind:value
    on:change
/>
```

The input field is a standard HTML input field. The `bind:value` attribute is used to bind the value of the input field to the `value` variable. 
To display the explannations when the input field is focused, we use the `use:explanationAction` directive. To set the focus on the input field in the first place, we use the `use:setFocus` directive.
The `explanationAction` is a function that we can generate using the `explanationActionFactory`. This function provides the logic to display the explanations.
The `setFocus` checks if the ODRL Builder is in questionnaire mode and if the component is focused. If so, it sets the focus on the input field, providing the `data-odrlLevel` and `data-attr` attributes to the explanation display logic.

```js
import { explanationActionFactory } from '@/lib/actions/explanation';
let explanationAction = explanationActionFactory(odrlLevel);

function setFocus(el) {
    if ($appstate == appstate.QUESTIONNAIRE && focus) {
        el.focus();
    }
}
```

To make the component usable in the questionnaire, we would need to add the component to the generic questionnaire component. Navigate in the files tree to `src/components/questionnaire/GenericQuestionnaire.svelte`.
In the generic questionnaire we the variable `fieldTypes`. This links the component to a keyword that can be used in the questionnaire configuration.

```js
const fieldTypes = {
    text: String,
    textarea: Textarea,
    date: Date
};
```
