# Complex Components for Entities

In the last lesson, we create a complex component for the permissions, prohibitions and obligations. Those entities are all subclasses of the rule entity.
Therefore, we can create one component and reuse it for all the subclasses. 

In focus you find the `Rules` component where we will implement the main logic. This component can be mapped onto the correct property within the ODRL. 

## Design of the UI part

The rules are stored in a list. To show the user an overview of what rules are already defined, we want to show this list in some way.
We therefore iterate over the list and display a Rule component that needs to be completed in the next steps.

Replace the third `TODO` with the following snippet:

```html add={1-8}
<section class="space-y-2">
	<div class="space-y-1">
		{#each rules as rule, index}
			<Rule on:change on:removeRule={onRemoveRule} bind:rule {componentConfig} {index} />
		{/each}
	</div>
	<button class="btn btn-sm btn-secondary" on:click={addRule}>Add {label}</button>
</section>
```

A new button appears on the UI. However, pressing the button does not do anything yet. In the snippet above you see the button's definition and that it calls a function `addRule`. 
To add rules we need to generate a template from the JSON schema and add it to the list of rules.

**Note**: It is important to use the spread operator to add a new object to the array. Otherwise, Svelte will not recognize the change and will not update the UI.

```js add={2-3}
function addRule() {
    let emptyRule = Schemas.getObjectFromSchema('rule');
    rules = [...rules, emptyRule];
}
```

Clicking the button now adds a new rule to the list. (Notice the changes in the ODRL preview on the right side). However, we still need to implement the `Rule` component to
actually see the rule in the UI.

Go to the `Rule.svelte` component and replace the second `TODO` with the following snippet:

```html add={1-36}
<section class="border border-neutral-100 bg-base-200 p-2 rounded-md">
	<div class="">
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Assignee</td>
					<td>
						<input class="input input-bordered input-sm w-96" bind:value={rule.assignee.uid} />
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Assigner</td>
					<td>
						<input class="input input-bordered input-sm w-96" bind:value={rule.assigner.uid} />
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Asset</td>
					<td>
						<input class="input input-bordered input-sm w-96" bind:value={rule.target.uid} />
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Action</td>
					<td>
						<input class="input input-bordered input-sm w-96" bind:value={rule.action} />
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<div class="flow-root h-10 pt-2">
			<button class="btn btn-sm btn-secondary" on:click={removeRule}>Remove {label}</button>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>
```

Pressing the `Add Permission` button now, also updates the UI. However, we still can't remove rules, if we decide that we don't need them anymore. 
For this every rule has a `remove {label}` button. But we can't remove the rule inside the Rule component. We need a mechanism to notify the parent component that we want to remove a particular rule from its rule list.
To achieve this, we emit an event telling the parent component to remove the rule.

```js add={2-3}
function removeRule() {
    rule = {};
    dispatch('removeRule', { index });
}
```

Take now a look at the `Rules.svelte` component again where we used the `Rule` component. 
```html
<Rule on:change on:removeRule={onRemoveRule} bind:rule {componentConfig} {index} />
```

We listen to the `removeRule` event and call the `onRemoveRule` function. This function removes the rule from the list of rules.

```js add={2-3}
function onRemoveRule(event) {
    rules.splice(event.detail.index, 1);
    rules = [...rules];
}
```

That's it. We implemented the rules component and can now add and remove rules from the ODRL.
This also is the last step of this tutorial. You can now
- Navigate the UI
- Configure the ODRL Builder
- Implement generic components
- Implement complex components 

Congratulations!
