# The User Interface

Before the user can start creating ODRL policies, they can choose their starting point. We will learn in a later lesson how to change this behavior. 

For now, let's click the "Start Questionnaire Mode" button.

## Questionnaire Mode

In this mode, the user is guided through a series of questions to create an ODRL policy. The user can navigate through the questions using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

The user interface is divided into three main sections:
- Progress bar on the left
- Questionnaire in the center
- Preview of the ODRL policy and explanations of the fields on the right

Try it out for yourself. Click the "Next" button and fill out the questionnaire.
Doing this, you might notice that time the value of the input fields changes the preview on the right side also changes. This is because the preview is updated in real-time as you fill out the questionnaire.

Now, let's change the values in the preview on the right side. You will see, that the values in the questionnaire are updated as well. This is because the questionnaire is also updated in real-time.
This allows us, to jump back into the wizard from any valid ODRL policy. 

Continue with the questionnaire and continue reading when the "Close Questionnaire" button appears.

## Overview Mode

When closing the questionnaire, the user is presented with an overview of the ODRL policy. This would be the final step before exporting the policy.

You now know the most important parts of the user interface. Feel free to explore the rest of the application on your own. In the next lesson, we will learn how to configure the ORDL Builder.
