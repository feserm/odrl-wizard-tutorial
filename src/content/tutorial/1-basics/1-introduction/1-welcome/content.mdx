# Welcome to the ODRL Builder

This is a tutorial to help you get familiar with the code base of the ORDL Builder.

First things first! Let's get you familiar with the user interface of this tutorial. The UI is divided into three main sections:
- The left side provides you with instructions. On the top is a navigation menu that allows you to jump to specific sections of the tutorial. At the bottom you find links to the previous and next sections.
- The right is split into two sections.
    - The top right section is where you will find the code editor. This is where you will be writing your code. Now all the code files are shown, but during the sections, you will find only those relevant to the current section. At the top right corner you find a `Solve` button that shows you the solution of the current tasks.
    - The bottom right section is where you will see the preview of the ODRL Builder. Code changes in the code editor will be reflected here. 

Now that you're familiar with the basic UI, let's get started with the tutorial. Click on the `Next` button below to move to the next section.

You might already have noticed that the Preview window is empty. This is because we never told the ODRL Builder App to start. To do this, we need to add the following code to the `index.html` file:

The file is executed top to bottom, so we need to make sure to put the highlighted code snippet after the configurations and code is loaded. 
```html add={14-23}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />

		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>ODRL-Builder</title>

		<script type="module" src="/config/basic.config.js"></script>
		<script type="module" src="/config/explanations.config.js"></script>
		<script type="module" src="/config/steps.config.js"></script>

		<script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
		<script>
			document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
				odrlBuilder.startApp('app', {
					config: config,
					prefill: config.prefill,
					steps: steps,
					explanations: explanations
				});
			});
		</script>

		<style>
			html {
				padding: 0;
				margin: 0;
				height: 100vh;
			}

			body {
				padding: 0;
				margin: 0;
				height: 100vh;
				font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
				background: rgb(255, 255, 255);
			}

			#app {
				padding: 0;
				margin: 0;
				height: 100vh;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

Let's understand what this code does:

```html {1, 8}
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
    odrlBuilder.startApp('app', {
        config: config,
        prefill: config.prefill,
        steps: steps,
        explanations: explanations
    });
});
```

We add an event listener to the `DOMContentLoaded` event. This event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed. This is important because we want to make sure that all the elements are loaded before we start the ODRL Builder App.

```html {2-7}
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
    odrlBuilder.startApp('app', {
        config: config,
        prefill: config.prefill,
        steps: steps,
        explanations: explanations
    });
});
```

When the event is fired, we call the `startApp` method of the `odrlBuilder` object. This method looks for a HTML element with the id `app` and initializes the ODRL Builder App. It configures the application with the configurations loaded in the `index.html` file.

```html {1-3}	
<script type="module" src="/config/basic.config.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="/config/explanations.config.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="/config/steps.config.js"></script>
```

Now that we have started the ODRL Builder, let's move on to the next lesson to understand the its user interface.
