# Different configuration files

To configure the ODRL Builder, three different configuration files exist. Each configuration file encapsulates a specific part of the builder. 
In this chapter you will learn how to configure the ORDL Builder to be suitable for your needs. 

The configurations are loaded from the config folder in the root directory of the repository. In the Files section on the right side, only this folder is shown for clearness. This directory contains three files:
- `basic.config.js`: Containing the basic configuration regarding UI design, prefill, etc.
- `explanations.config.js`: Containing the explanations used to provide field descriptions to the user
- `steps.config.js`: Containing the questionnaire setup for the ODRL Builder

At the end of this chapter, you will have a working example of the ODRL Builder. Try the solve button in the upper right corner for a sneak peek of the solution.
