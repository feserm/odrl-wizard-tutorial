# Questionnaire configuration

Now that we have configured the UI and set the correct prefills, we can focus on the questionnaire configuration.

The questionnaire configuration is loaded from the `steps.config.js` file in the `config` folder. In this lesson, you will learn how to write a questionnaire configuration that guides the user through the process of creating an ODRL policy.

In general there are two types of steps in the questionnaire:
- Steps that use generic field components
- Steps that use complex components grouping multiple fields of one entity

## Steps with generic field components

The syntax for a step with generic field components is as follows:

```js
{
    title: 'The title of the step',
    fields: [
        {
            label: 'The label of the field',
            type: 'The field type',
            odrlMapping: {
                jsonPath: 'The JSON path to the entity',
            },
            explanation: 'The explanation ID of the field'
        }
    ]
}
```

First, we give the step a title. This is displayed in the questionnaire as the headline of the step and describes what information is requested from the user next.
Then, we define the fields that should be displayed. For this we add an array to the fields property (`fields: []`). Each field is an object with the following properties:
- `label`: Freetext label that is displayed next to the input field
- `type`: `text`, `date`, `number`, etc.
- `odrlMapping.jsonPath`: JSON path to the entity (e.g. `uid`)
- `explanation`: Explanation ID (We will cover this in the next lesson)

## Steps with complex components

The syntax for a step with a complex component is as follows:
```js
{
    title: 'The title of the step',
    component: 'Component name that is used',
    jsonPath: 'JSON path to the entity',
    componentConfig: {
        label: 'The label of the component',
        explanation: 'The explanation ID of the component'
    }
}
```

The complex components are defined similar. However, instead of the fields array, we define a `component` property. This property defines the component that should be used for this step. The `componentConfig` property is used to configure the component.	


## Example

Let's try to configure the questionnaire we already seen in the lesson before. First, we want to introduce the user to the ODRL Builder, without overwhelming them with questions from the start. 
You can use a special syntax for this:

```js add={2-5}
window.steps = [
    {
        title: 'Welcome to the ODRL Builder',
        text: ['This tool will help you create ODRL policies.']
    }
]
```

As a next step, we want to ask the user for the identifier of the policy. We can use the generic field components for this:
```js add={6-18}
window.steps = [
	{
		title: 'Welcome to the ODRL Builder',
		text: ['This tool will help you create ODRL policies.']
	},
	{
		title: 'Provide basic information about the data usage agreement',
		fields: [
			{
				label: 'Identifier',
				type: 'text',
				odrlMapping: {
					jsonPath: 'uid'
				},
				explanation: 'DM-1'
			}
		]
	}
]
```

After the basic information is provided, we want to ask the user for the permission that should be granted. We can use the complex component `Rules` for this. This component can be used to manage the `permissions` of the policy. We configure it using the `componentConfig`:
- `label`: The label of the component. In our case we want to add `Permissions`
- `explanation`: The explanation ID of the component. In our case we want to add `DM-3`. Again we will cover this in the next lesson.

```js add={19-27}
window.steps = [
	{
		title: 'Welcome to the ODRL Builder',
		text: ['This tool will help you create ODRL policies.']
	},
	{
		title: 'Provide basic information about the data usage agreement',
		fields: [
			{
				label: 'Identifier',
				type: 'text',
				odrlMapping: {
					jsonPath: 'uid'
				},
				explanation: 'DM-1'
			}
		]
	},
	{
		title: 'Add permissions to your policy',
		component: 'Rules',
		jsonPath: 'permission',
		componentConfig: {
			label: 'Permission',
			explanation: 'DM-3'
		}
	}
]
```

Components should be generic enough that they can be reused in different contexts. This way, the questionnaire can be easily extended and adapted to different use cases. However, this is not always the case.
Because the `Rules` component is in fact reusable we can simple modify the step and add new steps for `prohibition` and `duty`:

```js add={28-43}
window.steps = [
	{
		title: 'Welcome to the ODRL Builder',
		text: ['This tool will help you create ODRL policies.']
	},
	{
		title: 'Provide basic information about the data usage agreement',
		fields: [
			{
				label: 'Identifier',
				type: 'text',
				odrlMapping: {
					jsonPath: 'uid'
				},
				explanation: 'DM-1'
			}
		]
	},
	{
		title: 'Add permissions to your policy',
		component: 'Rules',
		jsonPath: 'permission',
		componentConfig: {
			label: 'Permission',
			explanation: 'DM-3'
		}
	},
	{
		title: 'Add prohibitions to your policy',
		component: 'Rules',
		jsonPath: 'prohibition',
		componentConfig: {
			label: 'Prohibition'
		}
	},
	{
		title: 'Add duties to your policy',
		component: 'Rules',
		jsonPath: 'duty',
		componentConfig: {
			label: 'Duty'
		}
	}
];
```
